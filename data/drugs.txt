Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or artificial heart valves. Less commonly it is used following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and orthopedic surgery. It is generally taken by mouth but may also be used by injection into a vein.

Common side effects include bleeding. Less common side effects include tissue damage and purple toes syndrome. Use is recommended during pregnancy only if the benefits of preventing blood clots outweighs the risks to the baby. It should not be used during breastfeeding. Warfarin works by blocking an enzyme called vitamin K epoxide reductase that reactivates vitamin K1. Without sufficient active vitamin K1, clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X have reduced clotting ability. The anticlotting protein C and protein S are also inhibited, but to a lesser degree. A few days are required for full effect to occur.
